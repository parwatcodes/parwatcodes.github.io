            <p>Hello <span class="emoji">üëã</span>, I'm Parwat Kunwar</p>
            <p>Software Engineer based in Halifax, Canada.</p>
            <p>Currently, I serve as a Sr. software engineer at <strong>Technology Stack</strong>, a hospitality-focused
                SaaS operating in 85+ countries.</p>
            <p>My role in the TS team revolves around molding the product vision and language of design. Our team
                operates in a cross-squad mode, spanning all verticals.</p>

                <p class="pgraph">Former lead product designer at XYz Co and ABC as part of the global design team,
                    where I gained experience in global teams and solutions.</p>
                <p class="pgraph">I like the clean and simple design. I like to work with real data and interpret it
                    honestly. On the other hand, I believe in understanding the evolution of the product apart from the
                    data. I think about the intelligent user and interfaces with soul and personality.</p>
                <p class="pgraph">I love designing and making things happen. I don't like to stay in the postit. When I
                    start to develop ideas in my head I think about them in a way that I can start to make them
                    tangible.</p>
